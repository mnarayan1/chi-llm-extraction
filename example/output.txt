Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder involving deficits inbehaviour and cognition with onset in the early childhood years. Cette revue de la littérature a retrouvé peud’études à l’appui de cette théorie, la très grande majorité des études ne démontrant pas d’association entre ce vaccinet l’autisme. Upon endoscopy, all 12 childrenwere found to have abnormalities ranging from lymphoidnodular hyperplasia to aphthoid ulceration. Before an AmericanAcademy of Pediatrics committee,11he proposed that changes inintestinal permeability may allow neurotoxic intestinal productsto cross the blood-brain barrier, which may be particularlysusceptible during early development. Wakefield’s12findings of measles virus RNAin bowel diseasehave been supported by one report13which looked at autism inparticular,but have not been substantiated by others,14,15thusmaking it difficult to draw any conclusions regarding theassociation between measles virus and GI disease. Madsen identifiedcohorts of children who had been vaccinated against MMR(440,655 children) and those who had not been (96,648children). They found no reports of inflammatorybowel disorder in children with autism and no associationbetween developmental regression and GI symptoms. Since 2001, thimerosal present inamounts large enough to act as a preservative have been removedfrom all childhood vaccines except for a few influenza andhepatitis vaccines.34In Canada, the most common childhoodvaccines have been free from thimerosal since 5,35One must bear in mind however that these guidelines referredto methylmercury, not ethylmercury, and that inferring that onecompound acts similarly to the other may not be entirelyappropriate.36As well, methylmercury is transported across theblood-brain barrier via an active transport system, whereas ethylmercury is not. Theyalso note that rates of autism did not increase after epidemics ofmercury poisoning, such as the one occurring in the 1950’s inMinimata, Japan.36In a 2004 study by Ip et al,39mercury levels were comparedbetween autistic children and controls using a cross-sectionalcohort design. For example,EDTA, while widely used as chelation therapy in autisticpatients, in fact has a low affinity for mercury and is poorlyabsorbed in the oral form. This is particularly truewhen one considers that the incidence of autism has continued torise while the use of thimerosal has declined. As time went on and themore he was vaccinated, the more he started to change. Notknowing that mercury was in vaccines until he was four yearsold, I had no idea what was truly wrong with him . . . It has devastatedand changed our lives forever. . . Awareness and education should eventually help parents to becomfortable in making the best choices for their children in termsofgiving routine vaccinations at suggested times.
