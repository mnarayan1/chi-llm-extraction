Autism is a developmental disorder that affects behavior and cognition, usually starting in early childhood. Despite claims linking autism to vaccines, a comprehensive review of studies shows no evidence of a connection. Moreover, theories suggesting gut deficiencies or toxic substances in vaccines have not been supported by robust evidence. While thimerosal, a mercury-containing preservative, was removed from most childhood vaccines, studies have not found an association between autism and thimerosal exposure. Researchers have also ruled out a link between autism and mercury poisoning outbreaks. Despite continued speculation, the evidence points to factors other than vaccines as the primary cause of autism.
